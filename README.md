# Foodable
This is the repository for the Ionic frontend for Foodable, my submission for the 2018 Congressional App Challenge.
Foodable is a cross-platform webapp and mobile application designed for those of us in need to locate food banks near them.
Currently, it only has food banks in the San Diego Food Bank organization, but it allows for other organizations to sign up and get themselves on the map as well.
The backend REST API server is in a different repository also on my GitHub, [foodable-server](https://github.com/LucasBaizer/foodable-server).

# Using Foodable
You can build the mobile app yourself, or check out the webapp version (or even build that yourself as well)!
I'll publish an official mobile app on the Apple Store and Google Play Store soon.

# Donating
You can donate to San Diego Food Bank on their website [here](https://sandiegofoodbank.org/).
Although Foodable is not officially endorsed by SDFB, they do great work and I highly recommend donating to the cause.
Of course, getting people food is the absolute priority, but if you want to donate to help me pay for the hosting/domain of Foodable, you can donate to my BTC address, `13t1v56nwyj8gfek8CfVrqfokdSxRrmLDX`.
Any excess donations beyond the hosting/domain cost will go to SDFB.
